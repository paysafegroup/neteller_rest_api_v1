# Integrating the NETELLER REST API

The NETELLER REST API is comprehensive api that allows you to securely manage and facilitate your online payment needs.
The _**RESTful API**_ ([REpresentational State Transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) 
provides predictable, resource based URI's that removes the complexity that often comes with implementing
traditional SOAP or XML driven APIs.
<br/><br/>
This API leverages _**OAUTH2**_ as a token based authorization framework and works with JSON request and 
response object notation.

> The cURL samples included in this documentation are for reference purposes only. Substitute your own 
> values as appropriate. You can also refer to the [online cURL documentation](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) 
> for additional information on how to use cURL. <br/>
> <br/>
> The following flags are optional and may be useful during testing:<br/>
> <br/>
> `-k : (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.` 
>      `All SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle `
>      `installed by default. This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless -k, `
>      `--insecure is used. THIS SHOULD NEVER BE USED IN A PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION!`
>      `Note that if you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might be the option you're looking for.`
> <br/>
> <br/>
> `-v : Makes the fetching more verbose/talkative. Mostly useful for debugging. A line starting with '>' means` 
>      `"header data" sent by curl, '<' means "header data" received by curl that is hidden in normal cases, and a`
>      `line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.`

### 2014-11-04 Upgrade Notes

The following page outlines items to review when upgrading your REST API from v1 \(2014-04-15\) to v1 \(2014-11-04\).

> You can trial your upgraded integration with your TEST sandbox account prior to upgrading in production.  Contact NETELLER Merchant Support if you require assistance with your sandbox account.

Upgrade Procedure

1. Modify any calls to /v1/accounts to the new /v1/customers resource
2. If you are looking up profile details using the the former call /v1/accounts/{accountId} this should now change to this format /v1/customers/?accountId={accountId}.
3. To query for a profile using email, the same convention is used but the resource uri should change as follows: /v1/customers/?email={email}.
4. When creating customers (formerly accounts), you now post an accountProfile to the new endpoint /v1/customers and receive a customer object in response.  If linkbackurl was previously supplied as part of the accountProfile,  this has been moved to the root of that request and is no longer part of the accountProfile.
5. Ensure any embedded references to accountProfile information are updated to refer to customer details

### 2015-04-28 Upgrade Notes

The following page outlines items to review when upgrading your REST API from v1 \(2014-11-04\) to v1 \(2015-04-28\).

If you are upgrading directly from v1 \(2014-04-15\), then you should first consider the changes outlined in the the 2014-11-04 Upgrade Notes.

> You can trial your upgraded integration with your TEST sandbox account prior to upgrading in production.  Contact NETELLER Merchant Support if you require assistance with your sandbox account.

Upgrade Procedure

1. Modify create order calls to supply an array of billingDetail instead of payerProfile. Only one billingDetail is permitted at this time.
2. Modify invoice lookups to use billingDetail instead of cusomer resource.
3. If you are using our subscription services, the create subscription now requires the customerId instead of the NETELLER account id OR email.   When you ask your customer for permission to create a subscription through the authorization flow, you will be returned the customerId that provided the authorization.  If you have already received authorization from your customer and do not want to have to have them re-authorize, you can use the customer lookup call to identify the customerId for their account.
4. Payment lookups will now only return a customer object if the payment is related to an account holder.  For NETELLERgo! checkouts that are performed by guests, a billingDetail block will be returned.

# Technical introduction

This section provides a technical introduction to the NETELLER REST API. 

## API Endpoints

The NETELLER REST API is available in the sandbox environment for integration testing purposes. To switch between the sandbox and the live production system you only need to change the endpoint URI and the credentials.

The following endpoints form the basis of a resource URI:
* **Sandbox (Testing) endpoint -** 
`https://test.api.neteller.com`
* **Production endpoint -** 
`https://api.neteller.com`

_As the sandbox environment is completely isolated, any changes you perform on your sandbox accounts configuration (such as secure IP registration, APP registration) may have to be repeated in your production account._

***

## Versioning

The first time you make an API request, NETELLER will automatically record the the current API version and associate it with your merchant account. 
<br/><br/>
The API version will influence the request/response object structure as well as the functionality that is available through the API.   A new version of the API will only be introduced if we roll out a backwards incompatible change that may impact your existing integrations.  As your API version can be maintained through the merchant portal, you can manage when to upgrade to the latest version, helping ensure your integration is not disrupted as new functionality becomes available.

> You can update your API version from the merchant dashboard.  This is a manual process.  NETELLER recommends you check back
> periodically to see if new versions are available as there may be key enhancements that have been released that
> would improve your integration.
> ![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/api_version_upgrade.png)

_Outdated minor versions of the API will be supported for 12 months, after which point they may be deprecated and you will be required to upgrade to a newer version._

### Major Version

The major version \(ie: /v1/ \) represents a major technology shift between versions of the API. Changes in the major version are reserved for large scale changes to the API that fundamentally change integration requirements from the previous version.  Modified business domain models, re-design of functional flows or change in API resource patterns are all considered major changes.  Changes to major version are rare and typically require an extended deprecation cycle \(~2 years\) from prior versions to allow all consumers of the API to adapt.

### Minor Version

The minor version is a date stamped version of the API indicating when a backwards incompatible change was released in production.  Only changes that are deemed backwards incompatible will trigger a new minor version.   Other changes that are considered backwards compatible are integrated in the last version and rolled out as patches as soon as they become available.  The minor version is NOT specified as part of the URL request, it is defined as part of your merchant account and can be controlled through your merchant account portal.
<br/><br/>
_When working with the REST API, you should treat any identity fields returned by NETELLER as strings so that in the event we change the structure of the ID, it will not break your integration._
<br/><br/>
**What is considered a backwards compatible change?**

* Adding API resources or adding new properties to existing API resources
* Modification to the order of parameters or JSON object elements
* Adding optional request parameters to API methods
* Adding webhook event types

**What is considered a backwards incompatible change?**

* Removal of a API resource
* Removal of an API Resources object attribute
* Changes to required parameter / JSON object elements
* Removal of previously supported API call

***

## Pagination

REST calls that return multiple resources will wrap the response as a JSON array named 'list'. By default, 10 items will be returned at a time and you can navigate to the next page of data using the returned HATEOAS links.
Any list results will also include a meta data section that will identify the number of records included in the collection,
the number of records per page (limit) and current page number.
<br/><br/>
For example, if a request to look up subscriptions identifies that there are 134 subscriptions and you have set your limit to 15, the first 15 items will be returned with navigation links to the next 15 items in the list \(items 16-30\). If you navigate to the next page using the provided HATEOAS link, you will now retrieve items 16-30 with a new navigation link provided to return to the previous page, as well as a link to continue to the next page of items._

> _You can change the default list page size by defining a **limit** parameter value._

Parameter Name |Description
---            |---
limit          |The number of records to be returned per page. Default = 10, Max = 100
offset         |Identifies your location within the list and allows you to fetch the next set of resources

        }
    ]
}
```

## Resource Expansion

Resource expansion can be compared to eager loading in the database realm. It offers a way to load a specific resource as well as other resources related to it.  You are encouraged to use resource expansion when you know you are going to need the extra information. This will reduce the amount of API calls as well as the amount of traffic to and from your server. You should avoid resource expansion when you want to reduce the amount of information returned or if you are unsure if you will need the additional resource object.
<br/><br/>
By adding an **expand** query parameter to the query you are effectively telling the server to include the details for the reference object in-line, in a expand single response.  Anytime you encounter an object whose only child attribute is a link, you can consider that object expandable. Passing that object name as part of your expand parameter list will automatically substitute the link with the relevant details.
<br/><br/>

For resources that have multiple expandable children, you can specify which resources to expand in a comma separated list. <br />
Eg. <strong>?expand=resource1,resource2</strong>

<br/>

> _Resource expansion does not apply to API requests that return a list._

<br/>
Below is a sample subscription lookup. By default the plan and customer resources are not expanded and instead includes a 
reference link that would provide the relevant details. If you would rather have the full subscription plan object returned, 
then add the **'expand=plan'** parameter to your request and you will see the second example result.
<br/>

## OAUTH Authentication

NETELLER REST APIs are based on the OAUTH2 standard as defined by [RFC6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and require that you supply a valid OAUTH2 access token with each API request.  

The REST APIs utilize a 'bearer' token. For more information on bearer tokens see: [draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-23.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-23.txt)

### Obtain an access token

To access the NETELLER REST APIs, you will require an access token that can be obtained from the NETELLER OAUTH2 
token endpoint.  Obtain an access\_token by making a request to the NETELLER Token endpoint with the appropriate
grant_type identified.

> To obtain access tokens you must first register your client \(pplication\) you wish to integrate with.  APP 
> registration can be completed from your merchant account portal and will provide you with your APP specific 
> client_id and client_secret.  By default, the access token is a short lived one-time use token that expires 
> in 5 minutes.  If your integration requires frequent callbacks and you would like to be able to re-use the 
> access token, or require an extended token expiry time, please contact NETELLER Merchant Support to have your 
> APP settings adjusted accordingly.

The NETELLER Platform supports the following OAuth 2.0 flows

**client_credentials grant** 

Allows you to request an access token using only the client credentials provided to you.  This grant is used to access API functions that are under your control, and that do not require member authorization.
 
**authorization_code grant**

If your API request requires member permission (required scope permissions are identified in the section detailing each API operation), you will be required to use the authorization_code grant flow and will have an additional step of obtaining member authorization before you can obtain an access token.  This flow requires you to redirect your users to the authorization server where they will authenticate as a NETELLER member and approve the requested permissions.  The supplied auth_code can then be exchanged for an access_token allowing you access API functions on the members behalf.  
The client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user agent \(typically a web browser\) and capable of receiving incoming requests \(via redirection\) from the authorization server.

> These flows are intended for clients capable of maintaining their client credentials in a confidential manner, such as a client implemented on a secure server \(https\)

**OAUTH2 Workflow Diagram**

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/OAUTH2-Workflow-Diagram.jpg)


#### Obtain an access token using the client_credentials grant type

You can request an access token using only your client credentials \(client\_id:client\_secret\). 

> Your client credentials consist of a unique client_id and client_secret that can be found under the registered APPs section of your NETELLER Merchant Account. 
> The Authorization header should be constructed to pass a base64 encoded version of these values \(client_id:client_secret\).  If you are testing using cURL or a browser client, you can specify the HTTP Basic credentials by using the client_id as your username and client_secret as your password.
> <br/><br/>
> The client_secret for your application should not be shared with anyone or embedded in any code that you will distribute.  This exclusion also extends to an app binary that could be de-compiled.  This API call should only be made using server-side code over TLS.

**Request Parameters**

```

If the request failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server returns an [error response](#OAUTH Errors).

```apib

```

#### Obtain an access token using the auth_code grant type

> *Is member authorization required?*
> If the API resource does not require member authorization \(identified by a scope of *'default'*\), you can Obtain an access token using the client_credentials grant type instead.

The authorization grant flow has two parts and utilizes two authorization server endpoints.  

*1\) Authorization Endpoint* - used to obtain authorization \(auth_code\) from the resource owner via user-agent redirection.  
Your application redirects the member to NETELLER where they are asked to grant the requested permissions.  if the member approves, 
NETELLER will post back to your redirect uri with a unique authorization code that represents this members acknowledgement of your 
request.

*2\) Token Endpoint* - used to trade in the auth\_code, or previously issued refresh_token for an new access token  
The authorization code can then be exchanged for an access_token to use with your REST API calls.  This process can be repeated until 
authorization is revoked by the member or until different permissions are required.

**The flow consists of the following steps:**

1. The client app requests authorization by redirecting the user to the authorization endpoint. 
  
2. The resource owner (member) must verify their identity via a hosted authentication page.
   
3. The resource owner (member) is prompted to authorize the application.  The requested scopes are displayed and the member must Allow or Deny the authorization.
   
4. If the member authorized the requested scope, an auth_code is returned to your redirect uri.  This code will have a limited lifetime for you to complete the callback to redeem the access token.
   
5. Now you need to authorize your app.  Call the token endpoint with a grant type of authorization_code and provide the auth code from step 4. If successful, an access token is returned that can be used to make API requests on the users behalf.

> When invoking this flow, you must pass in the redirect\_uri that the user's browser will be redirected back to once app authorization is completed. The redirect_uri must be the same URI you specify when registering your web application OR must be the same one that was passed in the original authorization call.

**Obtain an authorization code**

```apib
GET https://api.neteller.com/v1/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_URI&scope=YOUR_REQUESTED_SCOPE&response_type=code
```

**Authorization Request Parameters**

Parameter Name  |Required? |Description
---             |---       |---
client_id       |required  |Unique identifier generated when you registered your application.
redirect\_uri   |optional  |The uri that the user's browser will be redirected back to once app authorization is completed. If supplied during this authorization request, the same uri must be supplied in the call to the token endpoint. When not supplied, the default registered redirect uri will be used. The redirect_uri must secured over TLS \(https://\)
scope           |required  |The supplied scope parameter will indicate the level of access you require for your app. The scope parameter MUST be supplied. If your application requires multiple scopes then you should supply a comma separated list. Eg. scope=perm1,perm2
state           |optional  |
response_type   |          |Identifies the type of response for this request. Valid values: code - for server side flows **Only code is permitted at this time 
lang            |          |OPTIONAL: preferred language to render the authorization flow in. see [Languages](#Languages) for complete list


The following request sample shows how to ask for authorization to obtain a members balance to show on your cashier page.

```apib
GET https://api.neteller.com/v1/oauth2/authorize?client_id=AAABRbRHwWkslo-a&redirect_uri=https://www.mysite.com/cashier&scope=account_available_balance&response_type=code
```

The following flows will be presented:
 
Member Authentication - Member will need to verify their identify using their standard credentials.

## OAUTH Errors

####Authorization Request Errors

If the member does not authorize your request, or the request fails for reasons other then a missing or invalid redirection URI  NETELLER will redirect \(via HTTP 400 - Bad Request\) the user's browser by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URL using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format.

> There are some error situations in which you will not receive the error back on your redirect_uri.   For example, if you attempt to supply an insecure http:// redirect.  In this case the customer would see an invalid request error.  For this reason it is important to validate your integration!

## OAUTH Scopes

Some resources available through the NETELLER REST API require that your APP be granted appropriate authorization by the member.  This authorization of permissions, also referred to as authorized scope, is managed by directing the NETELLER member to a page where they can choose to approve or deny the requested access.
 
The following list identifies the authorized scopes that are available in the NETELLER API. These permissions, or scopes, are handled on a per member / per access token basis.  To retrieve a resources protected fields, you must first obtain an access token using the authorization grant flow or previously issued refresh token.  You can continue to obtain new access tokens for the already authorized scopes until the authorization expires or is revoked by the member. 
For API requests that permit default scope, you may not require member authorization if the fields you are concerned with are offered as part of the default response.   In this instance you should use your client credentials to obtain the required access token as there is no required member authorization.

> The permissions associated with an access token are set in the /v1/oauth2/authorize call.   
Some API methods will limit their response data dependent upon which authorized scopes have been granted.  See the JSON Objects reference for details around which fields are returned by default and which ones require member authorization. 

Permission              |Authorized Scope             |Description
---                     |---                          |---
Subscription Payment    |subscription_payment         |Permits access to setup a subscription and automatically receive recurring payments from a NETELLER account holder<br/>**Member Prompt: Allow access to setup a subscription and receive recurring payments from your NETELLER account.**
Basic Profile           |account\_basic\_profile      |Permits access to your name, date of birth, country<br/>**Member Prompt: Allow access to view your name, date of birth and country.**
Enhanced Profile        |account\_enhanced\_profile   |Permits access to account address, city, post code, subdivision, account preferences and gender<br/>**Member Prompt: Allow access to view your address, account preferences and gender.**
Available Balance       |account\_available\_balance  |Permits access to view the members currently available balance<br/>**Member Prompt: Allow access to view your currently available balance.**
Contact Information     |account\_contacts            |Permits access to the member contact phone numbers.<br/>**Member Prompt: Allow access to view your contact phone numbers.**

## Webhooks

A webhook allows you to define an HTTP callback that will be POST to when an event occurs that you would like to be notified of.  You can define the notification URL and select which events you wish to be notified of from your merchant account portal.
> Webhooks will be sent whenever the state of the resource changes. Certain activity may lead to the same event being sent more than once.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/merchant-dashboard-webhooks.png)

**Responding to a webhook**

To acknowledge that you received the webhook without any problem, your server should return a 200 HTTP status code. Any other information you return in the request headers or request body will be ignored. Any response code outside the 200 range, including 3xx codes, will indicate to NETELLER that you did not receive the webhook.
> If your system did not respond with a valid HTTP 200 status, NETELLER will continue to retry the request with an escalating time delay for up to 48 hours

**Secure webhooks \(recommended\)**

NETELLER recommends that you use one of the following forms of authentication on your webhook URLs
 
**HTTP Basic Authentication - Use basic authentication syntax in your webhook URL:**

Format : https://{username}:{password}@{webhook_url}

each currency supports.  You must change the formatting of the amount based on the minor units for the 
specific currency.  For example, Japanese Yen does not have minor units so the amount should be specified as 
such.  ie: 50 JPY would pass 50 in the amount, 50.00 USD would be an amount of 5000, and 50.000 TND would be 50000.

# Getting Started

## Overview

This section outlines some common use scenarios of the NETELLER REST API. <br />

All examples in this section use cURL, which is a command line tool for transferring data using protocols such as HTTPS.

## Obtain your sandbox or production account details

The NETELLER REST API implements the OAUTH2 standard for authentication.  Below are the steps to follow when first setting up your
application. The same steps should be completed on both sandbox [https://test.merchant.neteller.com/](https://test.merchant.neteller.com/) and production [https://merchant.neteller.com/](https://merchant.neteller.com/) environments. You must complete all of these steps **before** you can attempt to obtain an access token for use in your REST API request.

### 1) Verify that NETELLER REST API is enabled for your merchant account.

If the API is not enabled, please contact [NETELLER Merchant Support](mailto:merchantsupport@optimalpayments.com) to have it enabled.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/api-enabled.png)

### 2) Register the IP addresses that will be allowed to access the API

_When registering your secure API IP addresses, you must ensure you are using the IP\(s\) of your networks outbound gateway. If you are working within a corporate network, or are sitting behind a proxy, you may have to contact your administrator to help identify the appropriate IP address\(es\)_

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/ip-whitelisted.png)

### 3) Register your application to obtain your API credentials

Your must register your application by providing the appropriate detail about its name, where it will be hosted, and what the primary contact email is to be. You may also choose to upload an application logo that will provide your customers brand recognition if you are planning to implement the authorization flow.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/application-added.png)

You are now ready to obtain an access token to use in your REST API request. Please refer to the 'Authentication' section for more information on how to obtain an access token. 


## Setup Subscription Billing

NETELLER offers recurring billing support through the REST API with the plan and subscription resources.

### Create a subscription plan

To get started, you must first define your subscription plan.  The plan provides details about your recurring billing such as the charge amount, currency and frequency of the billing.   You can provide a custom plan id to identify the subscription plan, however the planid must be unique across all active subscription plans.

**Sample request**

```apib
POST /v1/plans HTTP/1.1
Host: test.api.neteller.com
Authorization: Bearer 0.AQAAAUjshWvyAAAAAAAEk-Cj7vq1mEuIVz-2TomxIvnu.a4ixcq15cM6lCShJMIL7orHCI5w
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
Postman-Token: 01f33640-4ecb-370b-fe23-0f9b2d972b91

{
    "planId": "DEMOGOLDPLAN",
    "planName": "Sample Gold Plan",
    "interval": 1,
    "intervalType": "monthly",
    "intervalCount": 12,
    "amount": 2995,
    "currency": "EUR"
}
```

**Sample response**

```apib
{
    "planId": "DEMOGOLDPLAN",
    "planName": "Sample Gold Plan",
    "interval": 1,
    "intervalType": "monthly",
    "intervalCount": 12,
    "amount": 2995,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "status": "active",
    "numberOfSubscriptions": 0,
    "links": [
        {
            "url": "https://api.neteller.com/v1/plans/DEMOGOLDPLAN",
            "rel": "self",
            "method": "GET"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Obtain member authorization to enroll them in your subscription plan

Once you have created a plan, you will want to enroll members \(subscribe them\) to the plan. Before this can be done, you must first obtain authorization from the member so that NETELLER can issue re-curring payments on the member's behalf.   Obtain member authorization by redirecting the customer to the hosted authorization flow with scope of 'subscription\_payment', where they can approve your request.

See [Obtain an access token using the auth\_code grant type](#authcodegrant)for more information.

**Sample request**

```apib
GET https://test.api.neteller.com/v1/oauth2/authorize?client_id=AAABRbRHwWkslo-u&redirect_uri=http://requestb.in/1kk4mrn1&scope=subscription_payment&response_type=code
```

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/member-authorization-1.png)

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/member-authorization-2.png)

Upon successful authorization, you will be returned the authorization code on your specified redirect uri along with the customer id.    The customer id can be used to identify the customer when you request to enrol them with the /subscription endpoint.

**Sample response**

```apib
http://requestb.in/1kk4mrn1?auth_code=0.AAAAAVCNkWu3AAAAAAAEk-Azr8ttdq9qHdd74U2sed4J.cv1lK7A1riN9qykt-aFP7SWELj8&customer_id=CUS_A6B8F672-BA13-4AA5-8613-BA6018AF9B75
```

### Subscribe a NETELLER customer to your plan

Once you have obtained the required authorization, you can proceed to subscribe the member in your plan through the create subscription call. 

Subscriptions can be post dated to start at a later date by passing in an optional start date, but by default will start immediately and will attempt to collect payment as soon as you sent the request.
 
The first step in this process is to obtain a new access token.  This is completed by exchanging the members authorization\_code for an access token. Or by exchanging a previously issued refresh token if you have already obtained subscription_payment authorization from the NETELLER member.

**Sample request**

```apib
POST /v1/oauth2/token?grant_type=authorization_code&code=0.AAAAAUjxrXbeAAAAAAAEk-AMxBtcId3NytItAJjLUG6C.JDOulU_E5v2wSOvoqrSldXFv49Y HTTP/1.1
Host: test.api.neteller.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic QUFBQlJiUkh3V2tzbG8tdTowLmtnOG1wSnhOeER5ZUx2SVNVZ04wbHFsWWVWQS1UeFZSWlVFWThIdWljOEEuUzRuRnpPWS0wLTF3bW1qd3lGV2l0aUZwRGxz
Cache-Control: no-cache
Postman-Token: b22baf1f-256c-52c0-a52f-b6e1e04f19ec
```

**Sample response**

```apib
{
  "accessToken": "0.AQAAAUjxrhKmAAAAAAA27oDRqZ5aM7mnxrr7cgwhVFt3.3RdQp5PrOlirCqhmHybKsRUBINI",
  "expiresIn": 3600,
  "refreshToken": "0.AgAAAUjxrhKfAAAAB1jwsOBSE_xJsAYmavHS30lwvJ1B.YwlwdWKjPSa12NXvqvgV_C2922E",
  "scope": "subscription_payment"
}
```

Next, use the access token to subscribe the member to your subscription plan.  Here we supply the optional startDate so the plan will start as the beginning of the month.

**Sample request**

```apib
POST /v1/subscriptions HTTP/1.1
Host: test.api.neteller.com
Authorization: Bearer 0.AQAAAUjxrhKmAAAAAAA27oDRqZ5aM7mnxrr7cgwhVFt3.3RdQp5PrOlirCqhmHybKsRUBINI
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
Postman-Token: 5b2d14b3-963f-6ca4-d008-2952a013f7b8
 
{
    "planId": "DEMOGOLDPLAN",
    "customerId": "CUS_A6B8F672-BA13-4AA5-8613-BA6018AF9B75",
    "startDate": "2014-06-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Sample response**

```apib
{
    "subscriptionId": "SUB_0d676b4b-0ab3-4d78-af25-e452ab431e522",
    "plan": {
        "link": {
            "url": "https://api.neteller.com/v1/plans/DEMOGOLDPLAN",
            "rel": "plan",
            "method": "GET"
        }
    },
    "customer": {

            "rel": "customer",
            "method": "GET"
        }
    },
    "status": "active",
    "startDate": "2014-11-20T23:52:37Z",
    "endDate": "2015-11-19T23:52:37Z",
    "currentPeriodStart": "2014-11-20T23:52:35Z",
    "currentPeriodEnd": "2014-11-27T23:52:35Z",
    "cancelAtPeriodEnd": "false",
    "cancelDate": null,
    "links": [
        {
            "url": "https://api.neteller.com/v1/subscriptions/SUB_0d676b4b-0ab3-4d78-af25-e452ab431e522",
            "rel": "self",
            "method": "GET"
        },
        {
            "url": "https://api.neteller.com/v1/payments/138416527555633",
            "rel": "payment",
            "method": "GET"
        }
    ]
}
```

Customers that have a subscription will be able to see the subscription details in their member account settings.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/member-subscription-details.png)


### Setup Webhooks to receive updates about subscription payments

A webhook allows you to define an HTTP callback that will be POST to when an event occurs that you would like to be notified of.  You can enable webhooks through your merchant account portal.  Start by saving your webhook URL and selecting the specific events you wish to receive notification for.
 
See [Webhooks](#Webhooks) for more information.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/setup-webhooks.png)

You can trigger sample webhook event through the Test Webhooks function to ensure your service is properly exposed to capture the event.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/trigger-sample-webhook.png)

### Billing Process

NETELLER will automatically attempt to collect payment for all your subscriptions on their due date.  In the event the member has insufficient account balance to process the payment, NETELLER will re-try payment collection 3 times over a 7 day period.  \(1st, 3rd, 7th day after initial charge attempt\).  The member will be notified that they have insufficient funds in their account and that they need to top up their balance before the next retry.

**Failed charge notification email**

In the unlikely event that NETELLER is unable to collect payment for the current period billing, you will receive an email notification with an attached CSV file detailing any failed payments for the current day.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/failed-charge-notification-email.png)

**Sample CSV attachment:**

## Create a NETELLERgo! Hosted Payment

### Create an order

The first step in using the NETELLERGO! hosted payment flow, is to create an order.  The order may, or may not, contain a detailed list of all items / fees / taxes that you wish to collect payment for.  NETELLER recommends you provide as much detail as possible in the order request, as the more detail you can provide, the more likely you customer is to complete the payment as they will have a better understanding of how the total purchase amount was calculated.

> Your request should include redirect_urls for where you would like your customer to be returned depending on the outcome of the attempt to collect payment.

**Sample request**

```apib
POST /v1/orders HTTP/1.1
Host: test.api.neteller.com

```

### Redirect customer to hosted_payment URL

NETELLER will respond with a unique order id, details of the order request, and a HATEOAS link for the *hosted\_payment* flow that you redirect your customer to.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/go-1-choose-payment.png)

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/go-2-success.png)

Once NETELLER has completed the request, the customer will be directed to the appropriate redirection url as supplied in your create order request.

### Verify status of payment invoice

When you enable webhooks from your merchant account portal, NETELLER will notify when the status of the order changes and allow you to take appropriate action.   Additionally you can query for the order status or order invoice status to verify your payment.  Refer to the order and invoice object for more information on the various status definitions.  

> The order lookup will also provide related HATEOAS links, including the related invoice and payment.

# HTTP Responses

HTTP response codes are used to indicate the status of a request.To ease integration and support for developers 
integrating to our APIs, the error messages that are returned should be verbose enough to correct the problem.  
The error structure contains a 4–5 digit code as well as a human readable message. Additionally, the application 
error code will be returned in the header so it can be easily used by an application without parsing the body.

**HTTP Status Code Summary**

HTTP Response Code Category|Description
---|---
1xx: Informational|Communicates transfer protocol–level information
2xx: Success|Indicates that the client’s request was accepted
3xx: Redirection|Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete the request
4xx: Client Error|Indicates that the client has made an error with the request
5xx: Server Error|Indicates that an error occurred on the server side

**Common HTTP Response Status Codes**

HTTP Status Code|Description
---|---
200 OK|Everything worked as expected
201 CREATED|The request was successful. NETBANX created a new resource and the response body contains the representation
202 ACCEPTED|This indicates that the client’s request will be handled asynchronously. It tells the client that the request appears valid, but it still may have problems once it is processed
204 NO CONTENT|This is usually returned in response to a PUT, POST, or DELETE request, when the REST API declines to send back any status message or representation in the body of the response message
304 NOT MODIFIED|The client's cached version of the representation is still up to date
400 BAD REQUEST|This often indicates that a required parameter is missing or that a parameter is invalid. This is a generic client-side error status, used when no other 4xx error code is appropriate
401 UNAUTHORIZED|This indicates that the client tried to operate on a protected resource without providing the proper authorization. They may have provided the wrong credentials or none at all
402 PAYMENT REQUIRED|The parameters were valid but the request failed
404 NOT FOUND|The requested resource does not exist
405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED|The client tried to POST or PUT to a resource that would not accept it
415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE|The request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method
429 TOO MANY REQUESTS|The application is sending too many simultaneous requests
500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR|An error occurred with an internal server
502 EXTERNAL SERVER ERROR|We received an invalid response from the upstream gateway in attempting to fulfill the request

**Error Attributes**

Element|Type|Description
---|---|---
Element|Type|Description
code|String|This is the error code
message|String|This is a description of the error
details|Array|This is a detailed description
fieldErrors|Array|This is a list of fields that have problems

**Error message example with details**

```apib
    {
        "error": {
            "code": "5023",
            "message": "Bad request",
            "details": [
                "Illegal unquoted character ((CTRL-CHAR, code 10)): has to be escaped using backslash to be included in string value at  [line: 2, column: 61]"
            ]
        }
    }
```
 
 
**Error message example with field errors**

```apib
    {
       "error":{
          "code":5068,
          "message":"Field Error(s)",
          "fieldErrors":[
             {
                "field":"recipientEmail",
                "error":"john@hi@you.c.c.c.c is not a valid e-mail address."
             },
             {
                "field":"transaction.amount",
                "error":"A transaction amount is required."
             },
             {
                "field":"transaction.currency",
                "error":"Currency with value [USD] exceeds the maximum size of [3]."
             }
          ],
          "details":[
               "There are invalid or missing fields in your request."
            ]
       }
    }

# FAQ

**How long is a refresh token valid?**

A refresh token is valid until the member removes the permission or authorizes new permission which causes a new refresh token is issued.  The maximum lifespan for a refresh is a period of 1 year from when it was issued 

**What is a trusted device?**

A device that you have successfully authenticated to your NETELLER account from.  Your trusted devices are visible and can be managed through the member portal settings page.

***

# Authorization [/oauth2]

## Obtain an access token using client credentials [POST /oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials]

The Authorization header should be constructed to pass a base64 encoded version of these values (client\_id:client\_secret).  
If you are testing using cURL or a browser client, you can specify the HTTP Basic credentials by using the client\_id as your 
username and client\_secret as your password.

> The client_secret for your application should not be shared with anyone or embedded in any code that you will distribute.  This exclusion also extends to an app binary that could be de-compiled.  This API call should only be made using server-side code over TLS.

## Obtain an access token using auth code [GET /oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scope}&lang={lang}]

The authorization grant flow has two parts and utilizes two authorization server endpoints.  

> Refer to the OAUTH Authenitcation overview in the Technical Introduction for more information.

1) Authorization Endpoint - used to obtain authorization (auth_code) from the resource owner via user-agent redirection.  
Your application redirects the member to NETELLER where they are asked to grant the requested permissions.  if the member approves, 
NETELLER will post back to your redirect uri with a unique authorization code that represents this members acknowledgement of your request.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/auth_code-grant-type-2.png)

2) Token Endpoint - used to exchange the auth\_code, or previously issued refresh\_token for an new access token to use with your 
REST API calls.  This process can be repeated until authorization is revoked by the member or until different permissions are required.
 
> When invoking this flow, you must pass in the redirect\_uri that the user's browser will be redirected back to once app authorization is completed. The redirect_uri must be the same URI you specify when registering your web application OR must be the same one that was passed in the original authorization call.


+ Parameters

    + client\_id (required, string) - Your APP client id
    + redirect\_uri (optional, string) - The uri that the users browser will be redirected back to once app authorization is completed. 
    
        <br/><br/>If supplied during this authorization request, the same uri must be supplied in the call to the token endpoint.  When not supplied, the default registered redirect uri will be used. The redirect\_uri must secured over TLS \(https://\)
      
    + scope (required, string) - The supplied scope parameter will indicate the level of access you require for your app. 
    
        <br/><br/>The scope parameter MUST be supplied.  If your application requires multiple scopes then you should supply a comma separated list.  Eg. scope=perm1,perm2

### Exchange your authorization code for an access token [POST /oauth2/token?grant_type={grant_type}&code={code}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}]

Once you have received member authorization, you can exchange your authorization_code for an access token.  

+ Parameters

    + grant_type (required, string) - The type of grant
    + code (required,string) - Set to the auth_code previously received from the authorization server.
    + redirect\_uri (optional, string) - The TLS enabled redirection uri that will be returned to. 
    
        This value must match the uri used to obtain authorization, If not supplied during the authorization flow then the redirect\_uri will be the registered redirect uri for your application \(as set in the merchant.com portal under the APPS section\) and should not be passed.
 
+ Request Obtain authorization (application/json)

    + Parameters
        + grant\_type: authorization_code

### Exchange your refresh token for an access token [POST /oauth2/token?grant_type={grant_type}&refresh_token={refresh_token}]

If the previously issued access token has expired (obtained from the authorization grant flow) 
and you receive a HTTP 401 - Unauthorized error, you can utilize the refresh token that was issued to you with the 
initial authorization response to obtain a new one.

+ Parameters

    + grant_type (required, string) - The type of grant
    + refresh_token (required,string) - The refresh token previously issued to the client

# Payments [/]

The payments resource is available to facilitate the transfer of funds between accounts within the NETELLER system. A payment to a non-registered NETELLER member can optionally include profile information (including email, name, address, phone, birthdate)  that will be used to enhance the signup experience for new members, so they do not have to re-key in information that is already available in your system.

## Send Payment [POST /transferOut]

This is an outbound payment request and will issue a payment from your merchant account to the desired recipient account. You
can push funds to a NETELLER account holder or any valid email and NETELLER will notify the recipient via email of the payment. 

If the recipient is already a NETELLER member, the funds will be immediately deposited in their account. If the recipient is not
an existing NETELLER account holder, they will be required to complete their registration in order to have access to the funds.  A 
reference URL to the signup flows will be returned in the payment request response so you can optionally direct the member to 
complete the registration process.  

If you provide additional profile information with your payment request (such as name, address)
and the recipient is not an account holder, the profile information will be used to pre-populate the signup pages when you redirect 
the customer to the returned uri.

# Orders [/orders]

Order processing utilizes a hosted payment solution, also known as NETELLERgo!.  This hosted solution allows you 
to begin collecting payments from your customers with minimal custom development.  

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/neteller_rest_api_v1/raw/master/images/go-de-options.png)

> Contact the NETELLER Merchant Support team to have additional payment methods enabled for your merchant account, 
> or to find out what payment methods are available for a particular country.   See the paymentMethod object 
> description for more information.
> <Br/><br/>
> NETELLERgo! does not support iframes. It must be implemented as a browser redirect and not an inline iframe.


> Never rely on a redirection to determine the end state of a transaction, as they can fail or be tampered with. Always use a webhook and/or appropriate callback to obtain the transaction status.

## Create an order [POST]

Create an order by passing the revelant details to the /orders endpoint, NETELLER will respond with a link that 
you then re-direct your customer where they are offered the ability to pay using their NETELLER account or with 
one of numerous alternative payment methods.

## Verify Customer details [GET /customers/verify?email={email}&firstName={firstName}&lastName={lastName}&dateOfBirth={dateOfBirth}&houseNumber={houseNumber}&country={country}&postCode={postCode}]

The verify endpoint can be used to verify that member account details in the NETELLER system match with details you have for 
the member in your system. Call this endpoint with the specific account identifier and one or more of the values you would
like to confirm and NETELLER will return a MATCH or NO_MATCH result for each. 

VerificationLevel   |Description
---                 |---
00                  |Member has not been verified, no registered payment instruments
01                  |Member has not been verified, has one or more registered payment instruments  \(CC or Bank Acct Verified\)
10                  |Member is verified, no registered payment instruments
11                  |Member is verified, has one or more registered payment instruments \(CC, Bank Acct Verified\)

When you make your request, the input values will be normalized to remove special characters so there will be an 
increased likelyhood of finding a match.

# Plans [/plans]

Subscription plans allow you to establish a fixed recurring payment schedule with your customers.  Subscription Plans allow you define the pricing information and billing cycle for a subscription. You must first establish a subscription plan before you can offer it to your customers.

You can then enroll your customers by creating a new 'Subscription' request and NETELLER will automatically transfer recurring payments to your merchant account every period on their behalf.

## Create a plan [POST /plans]

Creating a subscription plan allows you to define a plan for having automatic payments transferred to your merchant account on a fixed schedule.

# Subscriptions [/subscriptions]

Members must be subscribed to a subscription plan in order for NETELLER to issue recurring charges on your behalf.  The "subscription" object represents a single enrollment of a member in a subscription plan.  

## Create a subscription [POST /subscriptions]

Creating a subscription is the act of enrolling an existing NETELLER account holder in one of your subscription plans.  Once a subscription has been created, payments will be automatically distributed to your merchant account on every recurring billing cycle.  In the event that a payment cannot be made (ie: the NETELLER account holder has insufficient funds available), we will retry to collect payment up to 3 times over a 7 day period.  If the payment is still unsuccessful and all retry attempts have been exhausted, a final notification of the failed charge will sent via email to both you and the subscriber.   You can optionally configure to be notified via webhook from your merchant account portal.

In order to create a subscription you must first obtain member authorization for the required 'subscription_payment' scope. See Obtain an access token using the auth_code grant type.  Once authorized, you can then exchange the authorization code for an access token that will allow you to access this API.

## Cancel subscription [POST /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/cancel]

By default when you cancel a subscription, the NETELLER subscription status is updated immediately to reflect a cancelled state.  If you wish to delay cancellation until the end of the current period, pass in the optional cancelAtPeriod end flag and the subscription will be cancelled just before the start of the next billing cycle.
